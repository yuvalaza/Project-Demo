## Introduction to Feature Selection

### Importance of Feature Selection in Machine Learning
                                                                                                                                                                                
Feature selection, the process of identifying the most relevant features for a given model, is
a fundamental task in both supervised and unsupervised learning. It aims to improve model
accuracy, reduce overfitting, and enhance computational efficiency by eliminating irrelevant
or redundant data. Effective feature selection not only simplifies models to make them more
understandable but also minimizes the likelihood of performance decline caused by noise or
unnecessary information.


### Categories of Feature Selection Methods

Feature selection methods can be broadly categorized into three groups: filter methods,
wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Each category has its own approach to
identifying relevant features, with varying degrees of complexity and computational
demands.
- **Filter Methods** aim to exclude irrelevant features before model training. They achieve
this by evaluating the importance of each feature through statistical measures and
then making informed selections.
- **Wrapper Methods** assess subsets of features based on the performance of a model
built with them, require recomputing the model for each subset of features and, thus,
become computationally expensive, especially in the context of deep neural networks.
- **Embedded Methods** aim to learn the model while simultaneously selecting the subset
of relevant features.
