# Feature Selection Learning Hub

Welcome to the Feature Selection Learning Hub! This platform is dedicated to providing comprehensive resources and tutorials on feature selection techniques based on the research articles authored by Dr. Ofir Lindenbaum. Whether you're new to feature selection or looking to deepen your understanding, this hub is designed to support your learning journey.

## :bulb: Introduction

Feature selection is a critical aspect of machine learning and data analysis, enabling the identification of relevant features that contribute most to model performance. Dr. Ofir Lindenbaum's research articles offer innovative approaches and methodologies for feature selection, spanning both supervised and unsupervised learning domains. This learning hub serves as a central repository for exploring and implementing these techniques.

Feature Selection using Stochastic Gates (STG) is a method for feature selection in neural network estimation problems. 
The new procedure is based on probabilistic relaxation of
the l0 norm of features, or the count of the number of selected features.
The proposed framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classification function while selecting a small subset of features.

Specifically, z_d is obtained by applying the hard-sigmoid function to a mean-shifted Gaussian random variable. Bottom: The z_d stochastic gate is attached to the x_d input feature, where the trainable parameter Âµ_d controls the probability of the gate being active|
