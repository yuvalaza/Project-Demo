### Importance of Feature Selection in Machine Learning
                                                                                                                                                                                
Feature selection, the process of identifying the most relevant features for a given model, is
a fundamental task in both supervised and unsupervised learning. It aims to improve model
accuracy, reduce overfitting, and enhance computational efficiency by eliminating irrelevant
or redundant data. Effective feature selection not only simplifies models to make them more
understandable but also minimizes the likelihood of performance decline caused by noise or
unnecessary information.




### Categories of Feature Selection Methods

Feature selection methods can be broadly categorized into three groups: filter methods,
wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Each category has its own approach to
identifying relevant features, with varying degrees of complexity and computational
demands.
- **Filter Methods** aim to exclude irrelevant features before model training. They achieve
this by evaluating the importance of each feature through statistical measures and
then making informed selections.
- **Wrapper Methods** assess subsets of features based on the performance of a model
built with them, require recomputing the model for each subset of features and, thus,
become computationally expensive, especially in the context of deep neural networks.
- **Embedded Methods** aim to learn the model while simultaneously selecting the subset
of relevant features.

## :books: Supervised Feature Selection Methods                                                                                                                        
### Overview

In supervised learning, feature selection is crucial for building robust models that generalize
well to unseen data. By focusing on the most informative features that contribute to
predicting the output variable, supervised feature selection methods help in enhancing model
performance and interpretability. 

### Key Approaches and Algorithms
### Feature Selection Using Stochastic Gates (STG)
[Project Page](https://runopti.github.io/stg/)|[Paper](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5085-Paper.pdf)

Feature Selection using Stochastic Gates (STG) is a method for feature selection in neural network estimation problems. 
The new procedure is based on probabilistic relaxation of
the l0 norm of features, or the count of the number of selected features.
The proposed framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classification function while selecting a small subset of features.

## :books: Unsupervised Feature Selection Methods

### Overview

Unsupervised feature selection aims to identify features that capture the underlying structure
of unlabeled data, facilitating tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and manifold
learning. Without the guidance of a target variable, these methods must rely on the data's
intrinsic properties to determine feature relevance.

### Key Approaches and Algorithms
### Differentiable Unsupervised Feature Selection based on a Gated Laplacian
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04728.pdf)

This articale proposes a differentiable method for unsupervised feature selection, utilizing a gated
Laplacian mechanism to enhance the selection process in the absence of labeled data.

### Deep Unsupervised Feature Selection by Discarding Nuisance and Correlated Features
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05306)

This article tackles the challenge of filtering out nuisance and correlated features in datasets. This work
proposes a differentiable method for unsupervised feature selection, utilizing the Laplacian
score criterion and an autoencoder architecture to effectively manage feature selection.
