# Feature Selection With DNN Learning Hub

Welcome to the Feature Selection Learning Hub! This platform is dedicated to providing comprehensive resources and tutorials on feature selection techniques, based on the research articles from Dr. Ofir Lindenbaum's [research lab](https://www.eng.biu.ac.il/lindeno/). Whether you're new to feature selection or looking to deepen your understanding, this hub is designed to support your learning journey.

## :bulb: Introduction

Feature selection is a critical aspect of machine learning and data analysis, enabling the identification of relevant features that contribute most to model performance. The research articles produced by Dr. Ofir Lindenbaum's lab offer innovative approaches and methodologies for feature selection, spanning both supervised and unsupervised learning domains. This learning hub serves as a central repository for exploring and implementing these techniques, as well as examining known approaches and algorithms, enriching the understanding of the feature selection field.
